        Gothic (or goth) weddings typically center around colors, themes, and
        decor that have a gothic sensibility â€” think black lace, deep red roses,
        and hauntingly beautiful venues. Gothic aesthetics stem from the
        namesake architecture that was popular in Europe during Medieval times
        from the 12th through 16th centuries.
