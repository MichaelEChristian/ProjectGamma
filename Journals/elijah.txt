Week 1
Journal destinations, sign-in page, testing sky scanner api 


Week 2 11-14-22
Found a database on data.world. The database is open-source with every airport, heliport, etc. in the US. 
The goal with this is to use the data as input information for the Priceline API I found on Rapidapi.com
Work on the destination page to have all the required input fields.

Week 2 11-15-22
Worked on destination page, I had to remove the carousel image from page. It was conflicting due to set classes being used, switched that with a image collage.
Bing api tested and it works.
