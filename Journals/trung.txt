Today, I worked on:

* Touching up the themes component and trying to make it dynamic/less DRY.

We all talked about our goals and visions for MVP. We're going to try and cut out a lot
of things and store them as stretch goals.

Today, I discovered you can't import components of cards inside carousels, you must
generate the cards within the carousel.

Finished making the NavBar and all its routes.

Currently working on learning modals for detail views of the theme cards.
